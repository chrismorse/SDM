### Stories worth telling
  > One of best managers I had helped me move across teams and areas within the company, helping me do what I wanted to do in my career and not worrying about how he would fill the gap. That is type of action that you remember for the rest of your career.
  
  > The best managers I’ve worked with have never made you feel you were reporting to them, in the traditional sense. It was more a sense of feeling that they really supported you and had your back. They give the team what they need — be it hardware, software, monitors, standing desks etc. or whether it is good process (if you control that), less meetings, better communication tools, right culture (okay to make mistakes), setting sane working hours, good team events etc. They create the conditions to enable this bunch of highly-skilled and highly-paid people to perform and get their stuff done. They are there for them when they complain or have a personal issues. They coach them along to plug gaps in their skills (both technical and soft skills), help them become better engineers and to gel as a team around a goal and vision.
